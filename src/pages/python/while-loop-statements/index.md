## While Loop Statements

While loops will repeat until a condition is met, and before each repetition, we will check to see if it is time to stop. Think of a small child who keeps asking the same question again and again until they get the answer they expect:

We use some new code in this example:

* **while** which is the keyword for the while loop
* **not in** which tests whether the answer is "Yes" or "yes". The program will repeat the question if the answer is not "Yes" or "Yes".
* ** answer = input**('Mom can I have a cookie?') which provides a prompt to ask the user to provide information. The input statement is common to user interfaces like web forms or familiar apps like Google. You can think of the Google Search bar as using an **input** statement.

Run the code a few times and type different responses at the input prompt to see what happens.

Here is a definition of while loops using the Frayer model which explains:
What are while loops?
What are the characteristics of while loops?
What are some examples?
What are some non-examples?

## Sleep How Can I Make a Time Delay in Python

To create a time delay in Python, you simply import time and then use the time.sleep(secs) function

Here are some examples:

import time
time.sleep(1) # this will pause for 1 second
time.sleep(5) # this will pause for 5 seconds

Let's try that last example in a little program that will count push-ups. We import a module called time which will allow the program to pause. In this case, it will pause after each push-up.
